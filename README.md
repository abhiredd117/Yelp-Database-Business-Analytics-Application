# Yelp-Database-Business-Analytics-Application

This project develops a database application for analyzing Yelp data to gain local business insights. It allows searching and filtering businesses by location and category, viewing key metrics, and identifying "popular" and "successful" businesses. A PostgreSQL database stores a subset of Yelp's review data for querying and analysis. The front end enables easy search and visualization of results. Using real-world Yelp data, it demonstrates database design, optimization, and location-based analytics.

**Front End:**
